    <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        The Demographic Statistics website provides valuable insights into various demographic indicators and statistics related to population dynamics. It is based on a comprehensive dataset that encompasses a wide range of demographic factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dataset used in this project includes information such as birth rates, life expectancy, literacy rates, mortality rates, and government investment in different regions and countries. The data is collected from WorldBank.
      </p>
      <p>
        To visualize and analyze the dataset, I have utilized a powerful suite of data visualization and analytics tools from Tableau. These tools include Tableau Prep, Tableau Desktop, and Tableau Public. Tableau Prep is used for data preparation and cleaning, while Tableau Desktop enables us to create interactive and insightful visualizations. The final visualizations are published and shared using Tableau Public, allowing users to explore and interact with the data online.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope that this website serves as a valuable resource for exploring and understanding the demographic trends and statistics that shape our world.
      </p>
